<b>Current Report: </B><BLOCKQUOTE>Velocity had a great week of rockfishing. The local reefs are starting to kick out some real quality fish, although you still have to work at it. 
The real shallows have been producing big blacks and some nice verm's.
 
Sundays trip was a no brainer for a change up at the island. Over 40 verm's in the 5-7lb range, crazy blues and browns with 6 keeper lings.
29 limits by 11:30.
 
The Princess and her new all "local" crew are scheduling their first overnight albie trip this Sat. night 10pm depart, Sun apprx. 7pm return.
